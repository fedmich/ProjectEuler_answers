# ProjectEuler_answers
Here are some of my different solutions & answers to mathematical algorithm problems on Project Euler.

I'm going to try and complete a problem a day when I got the chance.
I'm doing this to prepare for my Technical Interview with **Google**, I hope I pass it. Wish me luck :)

Oh and here is my progress so far :)
