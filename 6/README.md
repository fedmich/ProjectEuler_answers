Question #6 (Sum square difference)
====

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

<div style="text-align:center">1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385</div>

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
<div style="text-align:center">(1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025</div>

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 &minus; 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
